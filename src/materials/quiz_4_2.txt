Understanding Output

It's possible to suggest a wide variety of behaviors by specifying only a few quantities.

For example by specifying only a target lane, a target vehicle (to follow), a target speed,
and a time to reach these targets, we can make suggestions as nuanced as 

"stay in your lane but get behind that vehicle in the right lane so
that you can pass it when the gap gets big enough."

Look at the picture below and 5 potential json representations of
output and see if you can match the json representation with the
corresponding verbal suggestion.



Output A
{
    "target_lane_id" : 2,
    "target_leading_vehicle_id": 3,
    "target_speed" : null,
    "seconds_to_reach_target" : null,
}
Output B
{
    "target_lane_id" : 3,
    "target_leading_vehicle_id": null,
    "target_speed" : 20.0,
    "seconds_to_reach_target" : 5.0,
}
Output C
{
    "target_lane_id" : 2,
    "target_leading_vehicle_id": null,
    "target_speed" : 15.0,
    "seconds_to_reach_target" : 10.0,
}
Output D
{
    "target_lane_id" : 2,
    "target_leading_vehicle_id": 2,
    "target_speed" : null,
    "seconds_to_reach_target" : 5.0,
}
Output E
{
    "target_lane_id" : 1,
    "target_leading_vehicle_id": 2,
    "target_speed" : null,
    "seconds_to_reach_target" : 5.0,
}

VERBAL DESCRIPTION
JSON OUTPUT

"Just stay in your lane and keep following the car in front of you"
A

"Let's pass this car! Get in the left lane and follow that car"
E

"Let's pass this car! But first we have to match speeds with the car in the left lane. 
Stay in this lane but get behind that car in the left lane and match their speed."
D

"Whoa! This car we've been following is going too fast. 
Stop trying to follow it and just try to go the speed limit."
C

"Get in the right lane soon."
B
